In the first meeting on 2nd October we will briefly discuss what makes a good paper, and also agree on some themes, that fall under 'Climate and Cryopshere', that are of interest to the whole group. So have a think about an overarching theme that might be of interest to you, and you can suggest it! 

For example, we can keep it wide open or we can choose a focus such as: 
- Societal impacts/applications of glacier change?
- Contrasting glacier-climate interactions in the Europeana nd Southern Alps?
- Greenland glacier instability?
