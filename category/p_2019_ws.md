We have chosen to discuss papers under the broad umbrella of "**Applications and implications of climatically forced cryospheric change**". 

This should be a rich vein that sustains us the whole semester - it includes things like:
- what the changing cryosphere can tell us about climate/pollution/earth system interactions
- how changing cryosphere impacts water/society/sea level/ecosystems ...
- both new opportunities and potential risks/hazards of a changing cryopshere
- all the different kinds of cryopsheric systems (good IPCC description of components of the cryopshere: IPCC AR4 WG1 Fig. 4.1 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/fig-4-01-1.jpg">here</a>)

### Upcoming paper

On **17th October** Rainer will talk about journal metrics and predatory publishing.

### Looking further ahead ....

There is **no** seminar on 31st October and 14th November.
